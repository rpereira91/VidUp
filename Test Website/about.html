                <p>
                        Hello and welcome to my website!
                        My name is Ralph and I'm a computer programmer, web developer, and powerlifter. 
                        Right now, I'm in my fourth year of my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at Brock University. 
                        Although I had initially intended to study Accounting at Sheridan College, my passion had always been with computers.
                        From a young age, I was always interested in tinkering with computers.
                        After a year of Accounting I decided it was no longer for me, and started Software Development at Sheridan College.
                        Iâ€™ve worked on a number of small projects since then, learning as I create.
