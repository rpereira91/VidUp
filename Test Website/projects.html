                        <h3>Travelling Salesman Problem: Genetic Algorithm Solution</h3>
                        <p>
                            Genetic Algorithms, when used in computer science, mimics the evolution process by picking the best element out of a population set and passing it along to the next generation.
                            An element of randomness is used in order to make sure the best element, or chromosome, is truly passed on to the next generation.
                            Genetic Algorithms are used to solve many NPComplete problems in computer science, in this particular project it is used to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem. 
                            The population in this case is a series of chromosomes that represent travel orders between cities. 
                            The Genetic Algorithm is always trying to find the best chromosome in the population, hoping to get to a global best.

                        <p>
                            I did a bunch of smaller algorithm/logic problems in Python to. Some of them are more complex questions that can be expected in job interviews such as subset-sum, add on to array, all subsets of a set, and longest common sub-sequence. 
                            <br> There are other smaller problems as well that I wrote practicing for the larger problems such as listing prime number to 1000, calculating the fibonacci sequence recursively as well as iteratively.
